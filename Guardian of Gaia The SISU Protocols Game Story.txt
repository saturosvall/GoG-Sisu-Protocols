Guardian of Gaia: The SISU Protocols

In the vastness of the cosmos, on the outer atmosphere edges of remote planets, silent sentinels stands guard against the looming threats of space. Those planets, full of different forms of life yet vulnerable to the relentless forces of the universe, are facing an imminent danger unlike any they faced before.

From within the fabric of space itself, a legions of intergalactic raiders threaten the delicate balance of existence. Among them are the dreaded SpaceOrks, fierce and relentless, and the cosmic behemoths known as Asteroids, tearing through the void with destructive intent.

But the greater danger lies not in brute force, but in others such as the funny-looking, crazy Alien species, the SpaceHornets and the AstroMechaBats with an insatiable hunger for the planet's most precious resource - Y - aka photons. These elusive particles, photons, are the lifeblood of the planet's defense system, the PLANET SHIELD, the key to its survival. Other more obscure forces are rumored to exist, but if those rumors are to be believed.. there is even an intergalactic brutal army planning to invade.

As the planet's last line of defense, the Space Invasion Sentinel Unit (SISU) is called into action. Being the protocols that have been for eons, the SISU launches a desperate effort to prevent annihilation. The mission: to intercept and neutralize the alien threats before they breach the planet's fragile defenses and drain its essence.

But time is of the essence. The countdown to doom has begun, and the fate of an entire world hangs in the balance. As the last shreds of the planet's defenses wither, a call to action echoes across the cosmos.
